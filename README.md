# Image Processing

## Definition 
Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods.

## Types of Image Processing
There are five main types of image processing:

1. Visualization - Find objects that are not visible in the image
2. Recognition - Distinguish or detect objects in the image
3. Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
4. Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
5. Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image
