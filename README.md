# Image Processing

## Brief
Deep learning has revolutionized the world of computer vision—the ability for machines to “see” and interpret the world around them.

In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were designed to process image data more efficiently than traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

Since images contain a consistent pattern spanning several pixels, processing them one pixel at a time—as MLPs do—is inefficient.

This is why CNNs that process images in patches or windows are now the de-facto choice for image processing tasks.

## Definition 
Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods.

## Types of Image Processing
There are five main types of image processing:

1. Visualization - Find objects that are not visible in the image
2. Recognition - Distinguish or detect objects in the image
3. Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
4. Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
5. Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image
