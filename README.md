Types of Image Processing
There are five main types of image processing:

1. Visualization - Find objects that are not visible in the image
2. Recognition - Distinguish or detect objects in the image
3. Sharpening and restoration - Create an enhanced image from the original image
4. Pattern recognition - Measure the various patterns around the objects in the image
5. Retrieval - Browse and search images from a large database of digital images that are similar to the original image
